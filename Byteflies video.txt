Idea:-
	Greate idea they developed platform to build wearable health solutions that can track people at home
	
Technical parts :-
Diffrent types of sensors.
Signal and digital signal processing.
Raspberry pi and Android Things(Tansarflow).
Need to update by every feature can be added and be usful for the patient.

My point of view ,they didn't want to reinvent the wheel ,they use existing solutions existing technologies existing platforms to create a new product that puts the patient first.

Because of data processing on the cloud ,Caution from using sensitive medical data is somehow wrong
